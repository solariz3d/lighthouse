### node 24's `--test-reporter=tap` carries no file path, so per-file wall time cannot be read from a T-180 TAP
2026-10-19, D412 part 1 — checked on a two-file scratch run before the heavy one, then on the full suite at b306309.
Its top level is each file's top-level tests, flattened, with names and durations only. Each file's own test exists only as a
reporter event: `test:complete` at nesting 0, named by the path as globbed, `duration_ms` = that file's subprocess wall. A
custom reporter beside TAP gets it (`exo_memory/handback/p-d412-part1-O_2026-10-19_evidence/file-events-reporter.mjs`).
General form: check that an instrument can carry the figure on something cheap before a heavy run is spent producing it.

### The T-180 full suite's floor is one file: core-mutation.test.js, 1,991 s of a 2,422 s wall, so concurrency cannot reach 20 min
2026-10-19, D412 part 1 — `parse-tap.js` over the run's events: it starts at +24 s and ends at +2,015 s; the 15 mutation files are
70.5% of the per-file sum; at concurrency 4 the machine already averages 11.4 of 16 cores busy (machine-wide samples).
Could be wrong if that file's time was inflated by other seats' load in the window, which a machine-wide sample cannot separate.

### A gate of "git log -p <range> | grep -c <name> = 0" cannot pass while the range holds the commit that removes public lines
2026-10-19, D413 — the plain scrub commit fe5f9951 shows its 14 removed lines in `git log -p`, and one is context beside another
commit; 0 added lines and 0 messages remain, and every remaining match is already public at origin. The count that answers
"does this push publish anything new" is the ADDED lines plus the messages, not every line the log prints.
